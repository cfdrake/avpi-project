# Interactive Audio/Visuals Project

My project for Dadageek's Interactive Audio/Visuals with Raspberry Pi class: a gamepad controllable droning wavetable synth with accompanying visuals.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi
- USB gamepad (Playstation style)
- Pure Data
- Processing

## Instructions

Run both the Pure Data and compiled Processing patches.

Begin by tapping "Start" on the gamepad to connect to the TCP server in Processing. Additionally, ensure that the "Analog" mode is enabled for the joysticks if needed.

* 1/2/3/4 buttons: select wavetable
* left joystick: control main oscillator
* right joystick: control modulating oscillator
